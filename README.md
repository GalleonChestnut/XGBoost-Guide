# Guide to use XGBoost Model
These articles try to cover the hyper parameter tuning part in the XGBoost model

## What is XGboost?
XGBoost has recently become a popular algorithm in applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions. The model’s efficiency in computational time and usage of memory resources has built-up its reputation. Gradient boosting decision tree algorithm is used as the underlying concept of XGBoost.
